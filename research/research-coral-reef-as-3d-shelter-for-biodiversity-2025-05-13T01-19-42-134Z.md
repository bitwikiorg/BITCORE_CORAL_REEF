coral reef as 3d shelter for biodiversity

## Summary

## Summary

### Introduction to Coral Reefs
Coral reefs occupy less than 1% of the ocean floor but are home to more than 25% of all marine life, with over 1 million aquatic species relying on them for survival. 
* Coral reefs provide habitat and shelter for a vast range of marine species.
* They support an estimated 25 percent of all marine life.
* Thousands of species rely on coral reefs for survival, and millions of people depend on them for food, protection, and jobs.

### Biodiversity and Ecosystems
Coral reefs are believed to have the highest biodiversity of any ecosystem on the planet, with the Northwest Hawaiian Island coral reefs supporting more than 7,000 species of fishes, invertebrates, plants, and sea turtles. 
* Over 4,000 species of fish are dependent on coral reefs at some point in their life cycle.
* Coral reefs provide shelter, food, and breeding grounds for over 7,000 species in the Northwest Hawaiian Island coral reefs.
* The structural complexity of coral reefs is associated with higher fish density and species richness, possibly due to the availability of shelters.

### 3D Shelter and Habitat
3D models of coral colonies can be used to quantify shelter volumes provided by individual coral colonies. 
* Archireef's 3D-printed terracotta Reef Tiles achieve 95% coral survivorship in coral reef restoration.
* Morphological complexity and diversity are key design features for forming artificial reefs that can support marine communities.
* Effective 3D-printed reef structures may include a combination of prismatic and random shapes, with different external overhangs and inner holes.

### Protection and Resilience
Coral reefs provide a buffer, protecting coasts from waves, storms, and floods, and can reduce wave energy by up to 97%, providing protection from threats such as tsunamis. 
* Highly biodiverse ecosystems like coral reefs are more resilient to changing conditions and can better withstand significant disturbances.
* Innovative methods like 3D printing for coral reef restoration present a promising solution to protect marine ecosystems.
* 3D printing can facilitate desperately needed research on reef restoration and resilience.

### Conservation and Restoration
3D printing provides customized tools to integrate vital details of natural reefs, such as rugosity and complexity, into a sustainable manufacturing process. 
* Random tunnels, holes, intricate zones, and surface textures can create diverse habitats within a single 3D-printed reef structure.
* 3D-printed reefs can support marine biodiversity by recreating the complex geometry of natural corals.
* 3D printing can support targeted, small-scale restoration efforts, but will not solve global threats that reefs face.
