<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<h2 id="summary-1">Summary</h2>

<h3 id="introduction-to-coral-reefs">Introduction to Coral Reefs</h3>
<p>Coral reefs are underwater ecosystems characterized by reef-building corals, covering only 1% of the ocean floor but supporting an estimated 25% of all marine life. They are the most biodiverse marine ecosystem in the world, occupying less than 0.1% of the earth’s surface, yet providing a home for at least 25% of all marine species.</p>

<h3 id="characteristics-and-formation">Characteristics and Formation</h3>
<p>Coral reefs form at depths not exceeding 25 metres and need warm water between 20 to 28 degrees Celsius. They can be found at depths ranging from just a couple of inches from the surface down to 100 feet (30 meters), with some formations exhibiting coral growth beyond 40 meters in depth. Over millions of years, coral reefs can form around a sinking volcano, creating a lagoon and a barrier reef.</p>

<h3 id="biodiversity-and-ecosystem">Biodiversity and Ecosystem</h3>
<p>A coral reef ecosystem refers to the range of organisms living in and around coral reefs. Coral reefs are home to over 4,000 species of fish and 1 million aquatic species, including commercially harvested fish species. They provide habitat, feeding, spawning, and nursery grounds for various organisms. The coral reef ecosystem includes a diverse range of organisms such as fish, mollusks, worms, crustaceans, echinoderms, sponges, tunicates, and other cnidarians.</p>

<h3 id="importance-and-benefits">Importance and Benefits</h3>
<p>Coral reefs provide crucial benefits including food, protection, and jobs for millions of people worldwide. They serve as a natural barrier against waves, storms, and floods, preventing loss of life, property damage, and erosion. The ridges in coral reefs can reduce wave energy by up to 97%, providing protection from threats such as tsunamis. Coral reefs also support commercial and recreational fisheries, with more than half of all U.S. fisheries species depending on them.</p>

<h3 id="economic-value">Economic Value</h3>
<p>The annual value of U.S. commercial and recreational fisheries dependent on coral reefs is estimated to be $100 million. Coral reefs generate billions of dollars and millions of jobs in over 100 countries worldwide. The global value of coral reefs is estimated at $9.6 billion for tourism and recreation, $9.0 billion for coastal protection, $5.7 billion for fisheries, and $5.5 billion for biodiversity.</p>

<h3 id="threats-and-conservation">Threats and Conservation</h3>
<p>Coral reefs face significant threats, including climate change, pollution, overfishing, and destructive fishing practices. Rising sea temperatures can cause corals to bleach more often, leading to long-term damage or death. Human-caused activities like pollution, unsustainable fishing practices, and global climate change are major threats to coral reefs. It is estimated that over 70% of the world’s corals are directly and immediately threatened by local and global pressures.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Coral reefs are highly diverse and valuable ecosystems that provide numerous benefits to both the environment and human societies. However, they are facing significant threats that require immediate attention and conservation efforts to protect these vital ecosystems for future generations.</p>
