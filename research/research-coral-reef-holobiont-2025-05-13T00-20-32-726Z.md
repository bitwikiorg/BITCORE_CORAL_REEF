coral reef holobiont

## Summary

## Summary

### Introduction to Coral Reef Holobionts
* Coral holobionts are the foundational meta-organisms of reef ecosystems, comprising a complex association of different organisms.
* The coral reef holobiont is composed of the coral animal host, obligate intracellular algal symbionts, bacteria, viruses, and other organisms.

### Composition and Function
* The coral microbiome includes the coral animal and its associated microorganisms, collectively referred to as the coral holobiont.
* This holobiont plays a crucial role in the health and resilience of coral reefs, with each component contributing to the overall functioning of the ecosystem.

### Ecological and Economic Importance
* Corals are of significant ecological and economic importance, providing habitat for numerous species and contributing to coastal protection, fisheries, and tourism.
* The health of coral reefs directly impacts the biodiversity and economic stability of coastal regions.

### Specific Findings on Coral Species
* Antimicrobial activity associated with extracts from egg bundles has been found in only one of 11 coral species (Montipora digitata) from the Great Barrier Reef, highlighting the diversity and specificity of coral holobiont interactions.

### Conclusion
* Coral reef holobionts are complex, multifaceted entities that underpin the health and functioning of reef ecosystems.
* Understanding the composition, function, and importance of coral holobionts is essential for managing and conserving these critical ecosystems.
