## Summary

### Introduction to Coral Reef Microbiome
Coral reefs are among the most diverse and productive ecosystems on the planet, supporting high biodiversity of multicellular organisms that rely on associated microorganisms for health and nutrition. The coral reef microbiome is composed of thousands of microbes that help corals to feed, grow, and thrive.

### Composition of Coral Microbiome
The microbiome is made up of diverse microbes across kingdoms, with most cultivable bacteria belonging to the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria phyla. Corals live in a complex symbiosis with these microbes, which are crucial for their functioning. The composition of coral microbiomes can be influenced by both host and environmental factors.

### Symbiotic Association
The symbiotic association between the coral animal and its endosymbiotic dinoflagellate partner Symbiodinium is central to the success of corals. This mutually beneficial relationship began over 210 million years ago and is essential for coral health and nutrition. Up to 90 percent of the organic material produced by zooxanthellae is transferred to the host coral tissue.

### Role of Microorganisms
Microorganisms play vital roles in maintaining holobiont health and ecosystem resilience in coral reef ecosystems. Coral-associated microorganisms contribute to dynamic holobiont homeostasis through processes like carbon uptake, nitrogen and sulfur cycling, and production of antimicrobial agents. They also contribute to the physiology, development, immunity, and behavior of their hosts and can respond rapidly to changing environmental conditions.

### Impact of Environmental Stressors
Coral reefs have suffered tremendous losses due to anthropogenic disturbances. High seawater temperature is correlated with the prevalence and severity of coral disease. Shifts in the composition of coral microbiota often correlate with the appearance of signs of diseases and/or bleaching. However, corals can shift Symbiodiniaceae types to enhance resilience to environmental changes.

### Conservation Efforts
Microorganisms play a crucial role in coral reef ecosystems and should be included in reef conservation efforts. The microbiome of the reef undergoes shifts towards increasing microbial diversity in response to environmental stressors. Geographic distance is the primary determinant of community composition within each coral morphotype, at both island and ocean scales.

### Conclusion
Coral reefs are among the most biologically diverse and valuable ecosystems on Earth, and their health is closely tied to the health of their associated microorganisms. Understanding the complex relationships between corals and their microbiome is essential for developing effective conservation strategies to protect these critical ecosystems.
