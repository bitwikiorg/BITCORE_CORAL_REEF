## Summary

### Introduction to Coral Bleaching
Coral reefs have experienced extensive degradation worldwide over the past two decades, with coral bleaching being a significant contributor to this decline. Coral bleaching is a syndrome where corals expel their symbiotic algae, called zooxanthellae, due to stress caused by changes in conditions such as temperature, light, or nutrients, resulting in the coral turning white.

### Causes of Coral Bleaching
The primary cause of coral bleaching is rising ocean temperatures due to climate change. An increase in sea-surface temperature of just one degree Celsius for four weeks can trigger coral bleaching. Additionally, high levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, osmolarity, and high light can also contribute to coral bleaching by destabilizing the photosynthetic process in corals. Mass coral bleaching events are often correlated with increased sea-surface temperatures.

### Oxidative Stress and Coral Bleaching
Oxidative stress plays a significant role in coral bleaching, caused by elevated temperatures or exposure to UV radiation. When corals are under heat stress, they can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) through damaged photosynthetic machinery in the symbiont, which can overwhelm the antioxidant system in the coral host. Prolonged and combined heat and light stresses can induce ROS overproduction and scavenging ROS activity in coral hosts.

### Consequences of Coral Bleaching
Coral bleaching can have severe consequences for coral reefs, including increased mortality and reduced coral cover. A bleached coral is not necessarily dead, and some corals can recover from coral bleaching if the heat stress is not prolonged and conditions return to normal. However, prolonged elevated temperatures can cause more severe and extreme bleaching, increasing coral mortality.

### Impact of Climate Change on Coral Reefs
Climate change is the leading cause of coral bleaching, with rising ocean temperatures affecting most aspects of coral reef ecosystems, including distribution, survival, reproduction, growth, physiology, and productivity of marine organisms. Rising sea surface temperatures also reduce calcification rates in reef-building organisms, further exacerbating the decline of coral reefs.

### Global Significance of Coral Reefs
Coral reefs support over 500 million people worldwide and have the highest biodiversity of any ecosystem globally. The loss of coral reefs can have significant economic, social, and environmental impacts, highlighting the need to address the primary cause of coral bleaching, which is climate change.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, coral bleaching is a significant threat to coral reefs worldwide, caused primarily by rising ocean temperatures due to climate change. Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in coral bleaching, and prolonged elevated temperatures can have severe consequences for coral reefs. It is essential to address the impacts of climate change on coral reefs to mitigate the decline of these critical ecosystems.

- Stressors such as heat stress, osmolarity, high light, and ultraviolet radiation can destabilize the photosynthetic process in corals.
- Prolonged and combined heat and light stresses can induce ROS overproduction and scavenging ROS activity in coral hosts.
- Oxidative stress plays a role in coral bleaching, caused by elevated temperatures or exposure to UV radiation.
- High temperature and low salinity may aggravate the effects of coral bleaching.
- Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced through damaged photosynthetic machinery in the symbiont can overwhelm the antioxidant system in the coral host.
- Corals expel algae (zooxanthellae) when under heat stress, causing them to turn white, a condition known as coral bleaching.
- Increased water temperatures and UV radiation can trigger coral bleaching.
- Corals can survive a bleaching event but are under more stress and may starve without the zooxanthellae.
- Corals experience oxidative stress during seasonal bleaching due to elevated temperatures and solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation.
- High levels of antioxidant enzymes and small heat-shock proteins are negatively correlated with levels of oxidative damage products in corals.
- Ocean warming results in increased occurrence of mass coral bleaching, often attributed to overproduction of reactive oxygen.
- Increased sea-surface temperature causes thermal stress that contributes to coral bleaching.
- Corals can regain their algae and survive if heat stress is not prolonged and conditions return to normal.
- Prolonged elevated temperatures cause more severe and extreme bleaching that increases coral mortality.
- Corals expel symbiotic algae when stressed by changes in conditions such as temperature, light, or nutrients, causing them to turn white.
- The loss of microscopic algae called zooxanthellae exposes the coral's white skeleton and is known as coral bleaching.
- A bleached coral is not necessarily dead, and some corals can recover from coral bleaching.
- Rising sea surface temperatures affect most aspects of the Great Barrier Reef, including distribution, survival, reproduction, growth, physiology, and productivity of marine organisms.
- Rising ocean temperatures are the primary driver of coral reef declines throughout the tropics, resulting in reductions in coral cover.
- A rising relative sea level, currently estimated at ~11 mm/year, combined with rising sea temperature, has a significant impact on coral reefs in the eastern Indian Ocean.
- Corals turn white when stressed due to the expulsion of zooxanthellae (algae) living in their tissues.
- Rising ocean temperatures due to climate change are the leading cause of coral bleaching.
- Corals become transparent and expose their white skeleton when they expel the microscopic algae that live in their tissues.
- A temperature increase of just one degree Celsius for four weeks can trigger coral bleaching.

- Coral bleaching occurs when corals are stressed by changes in conditions such as temperature, light, or nutrients.
- Rising ocean temperatures caused by climate change is the primary cause of coral bleaching.
- A change in water temperature as little as 2 degrees Fahrenheit can cause coral to expel algae, leading to bleaching.
- Climate change causes thermal stress in corals, leading to coral bleaching and infectious disease.
- Coral reefs support over 500 million people worldwide and have the highest biodiversity of any ecosystem globally.
- Rising temperatures and increased carbon dioxide in the ocean reduce calcification rates in reef-building organisms.
- Marine heatwaves can last weeks, months, or even years and stress corals, leading to mass coral bleaching events.
