## Summary

### Introduction to Coral Reef Holobionts
Coral holobionts are the foundation (meta)organisms of reef ecosystems, comprising the coral animal host, obligate intracellular algal symbionts, bacteria, viruses, and other organisms. The coral holobiont includes the coral and its microbiota found within the coral body, mucus, and skeleton.

### Ecological and Economic Importance
Corals are of ecological and economic importance, providing habitat for species and contributing to coastal protection, fisheries, and tourism. Coral reefs are diverse ecosystems that support thousands of species and millions of people worldwide, making them among the most biologically diverse and valuable ecosystems on Earth.

### Composition and Mutualistic Relationships
The coral holobiont is composed of various organisms, including the coral animal host, zooxanthellae (photosynthetic cells), bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms. The mutually beneficial relationship between algae and modern corals began over 210 million years ago, providing both organisms with nutrients and shelter. Corals provide zooxanthellae with carbon dioxide, nitrogenous, and phosphorus wastes from cellular respiration, while zooxanthellae provide corals with oxygen and photosynthetic products like carbohydrates.

### Nutrient Exchange and Energy Metabolism
Up to 90 percent of the organic material produced by zooxanthellae is transferred to the host coral tissue, facilitating a tight recycling of nutrients in nutrient-poor tropical waters. The coral microbiome plays a key role in host health through energy metabolism, nutrient cycling, and immune system formation. Bacteria may contribute to the coral holobiont through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), with evidence suggesting the potential acquisition of the shikimic acid pathway by a common ancestor of the Anthozoa.

### Threats and Resilience
Climate change threatens coral reefs by causing heat stress events that lead to widespread coral bleaching and mortality. However, some coral species can be resilient to marine heat waves by "remembering" how they lived through previous ones. Corals in the Indo-Pacific may be more resilient to climate change than those in the Atlantic due to multiple species of thermally tolerant algal symbionts. Certain coral species can recover during a heat wave instead of afterwards, which is considered a 'game changer' for conservation.

### Conservation and Biodiversity
Coral reefs have declined drastically since the 1970s, with declines of up to 98% in some areas. The ability of corals to adapt or acclimatize to increased temperature extremes is crucial for their survival in the face of global warming. Indo-Pacific coral reefs have a greater balance in the relative numbers of major reef types and house incredible biodiversity, making conservation efforts in these regions critical for maintaining ecosystem health and resilience.
