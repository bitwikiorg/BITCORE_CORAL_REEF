# BITCORE CORAL REEF
Welcome to the BITCORE CORAL REEF project — an example knowledge base created using the BITCORE Research Terminal.

This repository demonstrates how structured research outputs from the BITCORE Research Terminal can be published as dynamic knowledge bases using GitHub Pages and Jekyll.

## Project Overview
BITCORE Research Terminal is a structured cognitive research platform designed for multidisciplinary innovation projects.
It provides researchers, engineers, and innovators with a powerful environment to organize, structure, and export high-quality research outputs.

BITCORE CORAL REEF serves as a live case study — showcasing a simulated multidisciplinary project involving oceanography, synthetic biology, and information theory.

The intended use case is simple:

Conduct and organize project-specific research inside the BITCORE Research Terminal.

Export the structured output.

Publish it as a modular GitHub Pages website using Jekyll.

This process enables teams to build self-hosted knowledge bases for projects like iGEM competitions, synthetic biology labs, multidisciplinary research collectives, and beyond.
