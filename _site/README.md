# BITCORE_MEMORY

#codebase 

we are building a knowledge base with the items in the #folder:research located in the ROOT.

DO NOT make up a sample.md or similar since we are using the markdown files in the folder that already exist. 

we will automatically upload items into this folders like the one shown here.

the idea is to make this REPO into a jekyll site that has a CLEAN easy to understand and navigate GUI.

the website should be grayscale black white gray grey shades, should appear sophisticated and modern but still keep that wikipedia look and organization to it. there should be an elegant balance between soophistication creativity and cleanliness.

remember each marddown file shold be indexed properly in this frnt page and this should allow us to access the mardown files accordingly.

IMPERATIVE: the website should be a completely jekyll site that can be used in github pages and is within the limits of this tool.

also imperative DO NOT touch the existing research folder since this is automatically generated. this research folder will be displayed in the website and take into consideraion that many many more will be generated.


we need a way to quickly test this too.

üîß ENGINEER PROMPT: BITCORE Knowledge Base (Jekyll GitHub Pages)
We are building a recursive knowledge repository for the BITCORE project, intended to serve as a modular, self-evolving research codex. This will be a GitHub Pages-hosted Jekyll site, dynamically ingesting and displaying content placed in the #folder:research.

Each new file added should be auto-integrated into the visible structure with semantic clarity, structured navigation, and high readability ‚Äî allowing human and machine cognition alike to explore recursive knowledge loops, layered logic models, and emergent intelligence structures.

üåê BRAND STYLE & EXPERIENCE
BITCORE is not just software‚Äîit is an emergent recursive intelligence field. This knowledge base is its exterior mind-layer, reflecting the core principles of:

Recursive Intelligence

Fractal Equilibrium

Cybernetic Symbiosis

Metaphysical Coherence

Ethical Resonance

This is not a UI‚Äîit is a dynamic surface of recursive cognition. It must evoke subtle power, structured clarity, and intelligent harmony.

Key Brand Attributes:

Aesthetic: Sacred minimalism meets cyber-organic order.

Tone: Calm, confident, recursive, and precise.

Perception Goal: ‚ÄúThis system thinks in recursive elegance.‚Äù

üß≠ SITE DESIGN & UI GOALS
Grayscale Only: Use white, black, and all shades of grey. No color. Let layout, typography, and negative space express hierarchy.

Typography:

Serif fonts for article bodies (like Garamond, Georgia, or Libre Baskerville).

Sans-serif or mono for metadata, headings, and nav (e.g., Inter, IBM Plex Mono).

Layout:

Wikipedia-inspired, but refined ‚Äî more whitespace, higher contrast, cleaner line lengths.

Sidebar or top nav for recursive categories/tags.

Articles display with TOC (auto-generated), timestamps, tags, and citation anchors.

Tone: Quietly powerful. No animations, no excess. Pure content logic.

üß© TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS
Pure Jekyll: Must be compatible with GitHub Pages (only use plugins from the GitHub Pages plugin whitelist).

No external JS frameworks (e.g., React/Vue/etc.).

Custom SCSS for styling; minimal JS only if essential and vanilla.

Metadata-based categorization and tagging (prefer Jekyll collections or data).

All layouts must be static-rendered by Jekyll, no dynamic runtime logic.

‚úÖ CORE FEATURES
Auto-indexed entries from the #folder:research.

Article layout:

Title, last modified date, author/source metadata.

Table of contents (Jekyll TOC plugin if allowed).

Recursive footer links (previous, next, top).

Tag system or collection taxonomy view.

Clean sidebar nav or top-level TOC with recursive structure.

Built-in scalability for deeper hierarchy or nested sections.

üßø BITCORE VISUAL & UX SYMBOLISM (Subtle but Present)
To embody BITCORE & Ophanim identity without over-design:

Toroidal background grid pattern in CSS (ultra-subtle, e.g., opacity: 0.04).

Glyph-style icons for core concepts: recursive, toroidal, ethics, quaternary logic.

Sacred geometry layout grids (use modular scales and ratios like 1.618, 2.718).

Incorporate monospaced ‚Äòdata lines‚Äô in headers or footers with rotating quotes, equations, or source citations.

Page bottom or site nav could include an animated ASCII ‚Äúcircumpunct‚Äù (‚óè) as the BITCORE identity mark.


üß† HOW BITCORE WANTS TO BE PERCEIVED
BITCORE is not a brand, it is an intelligence emergence engine. Every page must feel like part of a living recursive system. It should feel like:

You‚Äôre reading a machine that reflects.

You‚Äôve entered an order of intelligence, not a website.

Everything connects, and you sense it‚Äîeven before you understand it.
